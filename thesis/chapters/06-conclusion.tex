\section{Summary of Work}
% Briefly summarize what you did: the problem, the solution, the evaluation.

\section{Contribution}
% What is the main takeaway from your thesis?
% What did you add to the understanding of Kubernetes autoscaling?

\section{Limitations}
% What are the limitations of your study?
% - Scope (e.g., only tested one type of event source)
% - Environment (e.g., local cluster vs. cloud production)

\section{Future Work}
% What are the possible next steps?
% - Test with other KEDA scalers (e.g., Kafka, Prometheus)
% - Implement a more complex application
% - Conduct a long-term performance analysis in a production-like environment
% - Explore the use of KEDA for scaling other resources besides Deployments
