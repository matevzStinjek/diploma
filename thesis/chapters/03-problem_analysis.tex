\chapter{Analysis of the Problem}
\label{cha:problem_analysis}

\section{Limitations of CPU/Memory-Based Scaling}
% Discuss scenarios where HPA is not sufficient.
% - Bursty workloads
% - Scaling based on metrics external to the cluster
% - Cold starts and scaling to zero

\section{Need for Event-Driven Scaling}
% Explain why EDA principles are a good fit for these problems.
% How can reacting to events improve efficiency and resource usage?

\section{Existing Solutions and Their Trade-offs}
% Are there other tools besides KEDA?
% Briefly compare them.
% Justify the choice of KEDA for this thesis.
