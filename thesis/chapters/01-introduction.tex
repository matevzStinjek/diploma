\section{Motivation}
% Why is this topic important?
% What is the context? Cloud-native, microservices, etc.
Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in cloud-native environments \cite{kubernetes_up_and_running}. As organizations increasingly adopt microservices architectures, the need for efficient scaling solutions becomes paramount.

\section{Problem Statement}
% What is the specific problem you are addressing?
% e.g., Limitations of standard Kubernetes HPA for certain workloads.

\section{Goals and Objectives}
% What do you want to achieve?
% e.g., 1. Analyze K8s scaling. 2. Design and implement a solution with KEDA. 3. Evaluate the solution.

\section{Thesis Outline}
% Describe the structure of the rest of the thesis, chapter by chapter.
In Chapter 2, we ...
